game:
  #make an actual flow
    start, level select, play, reset, time
  #use different scenes, or different places in the same scene?
  ####stat tracking and score keeping

player:
  get someone to look over/refactor aim states
    It's so specific to _this_ game only, and including all the quirks is something
    intentionally coding it bad to be more authentic?
  add kick and hitpunch effect
    measure kick/time from game
    does it need horizontal offset or a random endpoint?
    should these be the same function?
  #add a jump maybe? (nah)
  #compare and test sensitivity levels with other DPI


weapons:
  specific weapons or player set settings?
  ammo, bullet speed, sway, ironsights, kick
  does the target do "onCollision" or does the bullet call a "class?.GetShot()"
  change bullet direction from "forward" to screenpoint raycast method 

  problem: gameObject vs Raycast:
    gameObject
      spawn bullet with velocity use physics engine.
      +literally a projectile
      -have to do continous collision detection on everything involved
      -at the mercy of however physics wants to deal with it
    Raycast
      bullet moves 1/speed*fixedDeltaTime checks between previous point and current point for collision
      +less overhead(gameobject instantiation, physics)
      -rewriting something that already exists (physics)
      -function tied to player that called it?
      -just a different way of making a game object?
        whats the difference between bullet.currentPos and Bullet(clone).transform?


target:
  make more human shaped
    get outline shapes from game
    face on vs side on
    how much more work is making targets vs puting in a generic figure
  different hitboxes
    head / upper torso / body
      health or number of hits?
  need "fight back" system
    target sees player for too long and causes hitpunch?
      length of time - player set, difficulty set, or dynamic set



level:
  close medium long ranges
    close - endless hallways
    medium - building setpiece
    long - open field/range
  get a napkin sketch from a level designer
    targets spawn from cover, peek out or run to other cover
    hunt compounds example
  put target tracks from cover to cover



effects:
  Don't care, It's just fluff until project is closer to completed
  ###record and add sound effects
  ###add actual art to the level
